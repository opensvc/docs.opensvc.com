Modules deployment
******************

Introduction
============

The compliance modules must be installed on all nodes with modulesets attached. All modules can be safely installed : only the modules included in attached modulesets are used. The modules must be installed in ``<OSVCVAR>/compliance/``.

Modules can be deployed using one of the following methods:

* Push mode : a trusted server is responsible of pushing the modules to the nodes. The difficult part is the target node listing. Such lists can be extracted from the collector database.

* Pull mode : each node is responsible from fetching the modules from a repository.

This chapter describes the last method.

Initialize the repository
=========================

The compliance repository file tree must organized as:

::

	ROOT
	+- current -> compliance.tar.gz
	+- compliance.tar.gz

Set up the published version
============================

The OpenSVC agent downloads the file pointed by the link named ``current``.

After the mirror initialization, you have to update the current link according to your own policies.

Tarball content
===============

The tarball file contents must be organized as described below:

::

    compliance
    +- 010-comp.module.a
    +- 020-comp.module.b
    +- com.acme
       +- comp.object.x.py
       +- comp.object.y.py

The command below can be used to create the tarball file:

::

    tar czvf compliance.tar.gz compliance --exclude compliance/com.opensvc


.. note::

   The ``<OSVCVAR>/compliance/com.opensvc`` folder is maintained in the os package. It will be erased each time you update opensvc. You must not embbeds it into your tarball archive. If needed, you can just copy its content into another folder like `com.acme`



Set up the agents
=================

The repository must be known to the agent. This set up is done with either the node.repo or the node.repocomp ``node.conf`` parameters.

**node.repo**

        This parameter allows to set up a URI pointing to a repository hosting both compliance gzipped tarballs in the compliance/ subdirectory and OpenSVC agent packages in the packages/ subdirectory.

**node.repocomp**

        This parameter allows to set up a URI pointing to a pure OpenSVC agent compliance repository. If specified node.repocomp overrides node.repo.

Example:

::

        om node set --param node.repocomp --value http://my.repo.opensvc.corp:8080/compliance/

Updating the modules
====================

The update command is:

::

	om node updatecomp

This command is operating system agnostic.

Automatic modules update
========================

The agent schedules a periodic compliance check run over modules of all attached modulesets.
The default schedule is weekly, on sunday. It can be redefined in the ``compliance`` section of the ``node.conf`` file.

When this schedule is triggered, the agent can run the ``updatecomp`` action before proceding with the check run. 
This behaviour, not activated by default, is triggered by the ``auto_update = True`` in the ``compliance`` section of the ``node.conf`` file.

This feature ensures the scheduled check runs always work with the lastest published modules.
Be aware that, while reducing the infrastructure maintenance cost and optimizing its reliability, this feature extends the perimeter affected by a bug introduced in a module.
