SOS Report Data Collection Tool
===============================

Sos (formerly known as sosreport) is an extensible, portable, support data collection tool primarily aimed at Linux distributions and other UNIX-like operating systems.

It is available on major distributions (RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, ...), and support OpenSVC environments (**sos version >= 4.2**)

::

    # check for opensvc plugin existence
    user@node:~$ sudo sos report --list-plugins | grep opensvc
    
    opensvc              OpenSVC cluster and services (config and state collection)

    # launch data collection **on both OpenSVC cluster nodes**
    user@node:~$ sudo sos report --all-logs

Support File Exchange
=====================

In case you need to share files with support team, you can use either email attachment or secure file exchange web portal

* open a browser to https://sfx.opensvc.com
* at the top right there is a ``Login`` field and button, fill in with ``support``, and click the ``Login`` button
* attach as many files as needed, and submit for upload
* once done, inform support team that your upload is finished

.. note::

    If allowed by network security policy, you can use the ``om <svcname> support`` or ``om <svcname> support`` command to automatically

    - build a tar.gz with all <svcname> needed logs
    - upload it to https://sfx.opensvc.com

.. note::
    
    You can also directly upload any file with ``curl`` command. In the example below, we use an internal web proxy named ``my.preferred.proxy``, and the file to be sent is named ``FILE_TO_UPLOAD.TAR.GZ``

::

    # export https_proxy=http://my.preferred.proxy:8080/
    # curl -k -F 'file=@FILE_TO_UPLOAD.TAR.GZ;type=application/octet-stream' https://user:support@sfx.opensvc.com/+upload -X POST
